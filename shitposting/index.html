        <h1 id="underTitle">A few rules to keep Shitpost and Memaly safe and friendly</h1> <p>Our community is all about memes. For it to keep going, treat your fellow Shitposters as you would like to be treated: with respect. We trust you to be responsible. Here are a few basic rules: take them seriously and respect the spirit in which they were created.</p> <h2>Keep it English only</h2> <p>Memaly is an international group: for this reason we encourage you to interact only in English, as to be understood by everyone else.</p> <h2>Keep it Safe For Work</h2> <p>We want you to be sure you can take part in a discussion or just scroll through the chat without being worried to have sexually explicit content on your screen. For this exact reason we don't allow any <strong>Not Safe For Work</strong> content: don't post anything you wouldn't want to see on your computer screen at work.</p> <h2>No violent, gory or harmful content</h2> <p>Don't post violent images, videos or any kind of media. Please refrain from posting comments that encourage acts of violence or self harm.</p> <h2>No hate speech and direct harassment</h2> <p>We do not condone content and comments that promote violence against individuals or groups.</p> <h2>No spamming</h2> <p>Everyone hates spam. Don’t post large amounts of untargeted, unwanted or repetitive pictures, stickers and GIFS. This includes epilepsy inducing GIFS and videos, multipart stickers, games, polls, spoiler messages and whispers.</p> <h2>No forwards from channels</h2> <p>Do not forward content from channels that are not in the Shitposting network.</p> <h2>No pirated or illegal content/activities</h2> <p>Do not post content that violates any law. This includes anything from Copyright infringment to more serious issues.</p> <h2>No doxing (sharing of private or identifying information)</h2> <p>Do not post pictures, medias or any piece of information that could breach anyone's privacy if you don't have permissions from said individual.</p> <h2>No impersonation</h2> <p>You may not impersonate others in a manner that is intended to or does mislead, confuse, or deceive others.</p> <h2>No bots</h2> <p>In yet another attempt to prevent spam we do not allow bots to be added to the group. You can use inline bots apart from those mentioned in the "No spamming" rule.</p> <h2>Admins always have the last word</h2> <p>We reserve the right to delete any content we don't deem fit for the group.</p> <p><strong>Remember to mention @admin to report messages that break the rules</strong>. Don’t abuse the system or this might lead to a punishment.</p> <blockquote> <p>The Shitpost Team</p> </blockquote>
